React Concepts:
  1) This course tries to build on each topic.
  2) Understand why React exist?
  3) Goal is to make you a React developer with critical thinking skills.

The Birth of React.js
  1) React came out in 2015.
  2) Before that, HTML/CSS/JS.
  3) Previously all browsers implemented browsers differently, needed to account and accomodate for different codes.
  4) There was jQuery to interact with the DOM.
    - Helped with a unified API.
  5) Developers started building bigger apps.
  6) The birth of SPA (Single Page Application).
  7) You only request from the backend once.
  8) 2010, AngularJS was born.
    - Formed containers.
  9) The idea of organizing large code to be easier to work with as teams increased in size.
  10) Things become more and more complex.
  11) 2013 React was released by Facebook.
  12) 2014 AngularJS was rewritten to Angular.

Declarative vs Imperative
  1) Don't touch the DOM. I'll do it.
  2) DOM (Document Object Model). JS manipulates the DOM.
  3) DOM is tree representation of the page.
  4) Imperative: Directly change individual parts of the app.
  5) Imperative is intuitive but difficult to see the relationship between events.
  6) React uses Declarative.
  7) React will hold a blueprint how it should look.
    - React will calculate for you and change for you how it should be changed the most easy and fastest way.
    - Build web interfaces without interacting with the DOM.

Component Architecture:
  1) Build websites like lego blocks.
  2) Reusable components.
  3) React uses small components to form a big component.
  4) All these components can be reused.
  5) React-bootstrap, Blueprintjs.
  6) Components are JS functions in simple terms.
  7) Components are functions that receive input/attributes (aka props).

One Way Data Flow:
  1) Unidirectional data flow.
  2) React have the idea of state.
    - Data of our app.
  3) We give React the state and component, it will create the virtual DOM.
  4) A JS version of the DOM.
  5) Gives React a blueprint of how it should update the actual DOM.
  6) React compares the actual and virtual DOM and updates what is needed.
  7) Data can never move up.
  8) State can only trickle down.
  9) This restriction helps to be easier to debug code.

UI Library:
  1) UI, The rest is up to you.
  2) AngularJS is a framework, like a kitchen.
    - A framework gives you every tool to build a complete app.
  3) React only cares about the UI.
  4) React able to use at other places other than the web due to this feature.
  5) Ex. React Native, React 360 (VR), React Desktop
  6) We import 2 libraries, the React core library and the Reat DOM library.

How To Be A Great React Developer:
  1) It made building large scale applications more pleasant.
  2) There are new ones that are using these concepts and principles.
  3) The job of a React developer:
    - Decide on Components.
    - Decide the State and where it lives.
    - What changes should be made when state changes.
      - This has huge effect on performance.
